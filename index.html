                                        as excellent candidates for the next generation of neural interfaces. Their
                                        wireless nature, coupled with their subcellular dimensions, holds the promise of
                                        enabling minimally invasive neuromodulation with high spatial resolution within
                                        three-dimensional tissues. Nevertheless, their practical implementation is
                                        hindered by technical challenges. Specifically, fabricating freestanding devices
                                        with subcellular sizes proves exceedingly difficult, and characterizing their
                                        functionality in a representative freestanding configuration presents an even
                                        greater challenge. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for
                                        fabricating and characterizing freestanding micro-nanodevices, aimed at
                                        advancing progress in neural interfaces. We developed three distinct
                                        micro-nanofabrication methods tailored for manufacturing freestanding micro-
                                        nanodevices with varying characteristics. These methods include a very
                                        large-scale integration process for manufacturing and manipulating freestanding
                                        microdevices (2 to 200 µm) with high throughput, a cell-friendly approach
                                        utilizing only biocompatible materials and solvents for rapid microdevice
                                        production, and a protocol for fabricating and handling freestanding devices
                                        with even smaller size scale (200 nm to 3 µm). We subsequently devised an
                                        effective approach to rapidly characterize the electrical modulation
                                        capabilities of freestanding micro-nanodevices in a cell-like environment,
                                        employing artificial bilayer lipid membranes. We showcased this method by
                                        studying the variation of bilayer lipid membrane transmembrane potential in
                                        response to light when sprinkled with organic semiconductor devices. Ultimately,
                                        we established an analytical model of the characterization system to translate
                                        experimental findings made with bilayer lipid membrane into single cells. By
                                        overcoming the technical limitations hindering the fabrication, manipulation,
                                        and characterization of freestanding micro-nanodevices, we hope that our
                                        research efforts will contribute to accelerating progress in the development of
                                        next-generation neural interfaces and unlock the full potential of
                                        neuromodulation technologies in fundamental and clinical research.</i></p>

                                        stimulation are used to treat brain disorders but require invasive surgery. To
                                        provide a non-invasive alternative, we report non-surgical implants consisting
                                        of immune cell–bioelectronics hybrids, an approach we call Circulatronics. The
                                        devices can be delivered intravenously and traffic autonomously to regions of
                                        inflammation in brain, where they implant and affect neuromodulation,
                                        circumventing the need for surgery. To achieve suitable electronics, we
                                        designed and built subcellular-sized, wireless, photovoltaic electronic devices
                                        (SWEDs) that harvest optical energy with high power conversion efficiency. In
                                        mice, we demonstrate non-surgical implantation in inflamed brain region as an
                                        example of therapeutic target for several neural diseases, by employing
                                        monocytes as cells, covalently attaching them to the SWEDs and administering the
                                        resulting hybrids intravenously. We also demonstrate neural stimulation with 30
                                        µm precision around the inflamed region. Thus, by fusing electronic
                                        functionality with the biological transport and targeting capabilities of living
                                        cells, this technology can form the foundation for autonomously implanting
                                        bioelectronics.</i></p>

                                        harvesting in injectable deep-tissue implants. The antenna operates at the

                                        emerged as promising candidates for sensing applications due to their unique
                                        properties. This review discusses the use of 2D materials in field-effect
                                        transistors (FETs) and nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) for detecting gases,
                                        chemicals, and biomolecules. The advantages of 2D material-based sensors,
                                        including small size, low cost, and mass manufacturability, are highlighted for
                                        applications in healthcare, security, forensic industries, and environmental
                                        protection.</i></p>
